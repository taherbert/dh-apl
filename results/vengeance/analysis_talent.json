This lowers SBomb threshold to 3 during FD window because the 30% FD amp makes a 3-frag SBomb (effective: 0.4 * 3 * 1.30 = 1.56 AP) more valuable per GCD than waiting for 5 frags while the Brand window ticks down. Anni has NO equivalent. In the anni list, SBomb fires only at spb_threshold (5, or 4 during Meta). During a Brand window in Anni, the player waits for 5 frags while Brand ticks expire -- wasting FD amp GCDs on Fracture that generates fragments but does not benefit from the fire amp as much as an early SBomb would. The anni_voidfall sub-list has SBomb at spending.stack=3 gated on >=spb_threshold, which is correct for Voidfall timing but misses the FD opportunity.",

The interaction data shows Spirit Bomb receives: Fiery Demise 30%, Burning Blood 8%, Meta 20%, Frailty 3-11% (Soulcrush dependent).
