      "explanation": "During a Brand window (~10s with Charred Flesh extensions), you want to cast: Soul Carver, Spirit Bomb, Fel Devastation, Sigil of Spite — all fire/shadowflame school abilities that benefit from Fiery Demise. But with ~7 GCDs available, plus Fracture for fragment generation and the AR/Anni cycle demands, GCD budget saturates. Not everything fits, requiring triage.",

      "description": "SBomb threshold should drop during Fiery Demise windows (AR)",
      "explanation": "Fiery Demise provides +30% fire damage. A 3-fragment SBomb during FD (3 × base × 1.3 = 3.9 × base) is worth casting even though a 5-frag outside FD (5 × base) is nominally stronger per-cast — the throughput gain from more FD-window casts dominates. Confirmed +0.18% weighted, +0.30% AR. Does NOT help Anni (Voidfall cycle manages its own SBomb timing).",

      "explanation": "Fury surplus is ~100-200/min (460-510 gen vs 311-381 consumed). Fragment surplus is ~12-24/min (36-44 gen vs 20-24 consumed, 34% overflow). The real constraint is GCDs: 30 GCDs in 30s leaves no room for additional abilities. Priority optimization must focus on which abilities get GCDs, not resource management.",
